First, you install Homebrew. 
# Installs Homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Second, find the MongoDB tap.
------------------------------
brew tap mongodb/brew
------------------------------

Third, install MongoDB.
------------------------------
brew install mongodb-community
------------------------------

Below is the process before MacOS Catalina: 

Before you can use MongoDB, you need to create a /data/db folder on your computer to use MongoDB. You can create this folder with the following command:
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
You also need to give permissions to use it:
sudo chown -R `id -un` /data/db

Below is the process from MacOS Catalina onwards:
Apple created a new Volume in Catalina for security purposes. If you’re on Catalina, you need to create the /data/db folder in System/Volumes/Data.
Use this command:
sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
Then, use this command to give permissions:
sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db

In the past, I can run the mongod command to start MongoDB. This no longer works out for the box from MongoDB v4.2.3 onwards.
The best way to start MongoDB now is via brew services.
Starting MongoDB
Use this command:
brew services run mongodb-community

MongoDB will start as a background service.
You can use start instead of run. start will start MongoDB automatically when you login into your Macbook. I prefer run since I don’t want MongoDB to be running all the time.

Checking if MongoDB is running
Use this command:
brew services list
Homebrew will list all running services. If MongoDB is running, mongodb-community will have a status set to started.
Mongodb-community has status set to started.
The Mongo Shell
If MongoDB is running, you should be able to access the Mongo shell with the mongo command.
mongo

Stopping MongoDB
Use this command:
brew services stop mongodb-community
Homebrew will stop MongoDB and let you know.
Stopped MongoDB
Aliases to make these easier
It’s a chore typing brew services run mongodb-community every time I want to start MongoDB.
I created some aliases to make things easier for me. Here are my aliases:
alias mongod='brew services run mongodb-community'
alias mongod-status='brew services list'
alias mongod-stop='brew services stop mongodb-community'
